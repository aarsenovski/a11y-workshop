This React app contains of a simple Card component, for which we would like to add some automated accessibility tests using jest-axe. In order to do that you would need to:

1. Install jest-axe - a custom Jest matcher for axe for testing accessibility
2. Install jest-dom - a companion library for Testing Library that provides custom DOM element matchers for Jest
3. In the 'components' folder create a Card.test.tsx file and write a test that checks if the Card component has any accessibility issues.
4. Run the test to ensure no accessibility issues are present

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

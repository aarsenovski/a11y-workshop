  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      By scanning headings alone, users shoud get a good idea of the page
      content
    </li>
    <li>
      Assign the the h1 tag to the main headline of the page - DO NOT apply H1
      tags to your logo, site name or any other site-wide element
    </li>
    <li>Heading levels can't be skipped, i.e. you cant jump from h1 to h3</li>
  </ul>

    Semantic markup is used to designate headings (h1 - h6), lists (u, ol and

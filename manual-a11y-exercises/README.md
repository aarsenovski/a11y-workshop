The content in these exercises is missing some accessibility requirements in order to be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. Regardless of their ability, everyone should be able to navigate easily across this content and make a use of the pages. It is your job to fix those accessibility remarks.

2. Use axe DevTools extension to scan the page for any accessibility remarks

   - Name: axe DevTools - Web Accessibility Testing
   - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd

3. Use axe Wave Evaluation tool extension to scan the page for any accessibility remarks

   - Name: WAVE Evaluation Tool
   - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh

Target: Ensure no serious/critical errors are found by the two accessibility tools. Accessibility remark around 'No Page region' can be safely skipped in this exercises as it's out of scope.
